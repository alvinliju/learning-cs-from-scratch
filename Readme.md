Currently stopped working on all my webdev projects to go all in learning cs from low level programming, all these abstractions makes me sick. I hate when i dont understand the underlying tech and how it works thats why i started with this repo.

This repo will consider small projects that helped me go from 0-1 as a programmer and i know with AI and "vibe coding" and MCP's i dont have to do all these but i just love this craft too much ig. Consider this repo as my study journal/guide.



### PHASE 1: Learn by being in the trenches(coding in c for a month)
- Finish contact management
- Create a file organizer that sorts files by type
- Build a basic text processor/parser
- Write a simple key-value database
- Implement a mini HTTP server
- Text search: find substring in a file (“grep-lite”)
- Code your own UNIX utilities (ls, grep).
- Implement Ceaser Cipher in C.
- Implement Djakstra's algo in C.
- Text Editor in C.


### PHASE 2: Operating Systems & Computer Architecture
- Write a kernel module that crashes the OS → Fix it.
- Code a rootkit that hides processes → Battle dmesg logs.


### PHASE 3: Reverse Engineering & Exploitation

- Reverse engineer progressively harder crackmes
- Analyze and modify simple binaries to bypass protections
- Build a buffer overflow exploit for a vulnerable program
- Create a format string exploit


### PHASE 4: Advanced Offensive Security

- Develop a simple fuzzer to find vulnerabilities
- Analyze real-world malware samples in a safe environment
- Create a proof-of-concept exploit for a known CVE
