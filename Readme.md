Currently stopped working on all my webdev projects to go all in learning cs from low level programming, all these abstractions makes me sick. I hate when i dont understand the underlying tech and how it works thats why i started with this repo.

This repo will consider small projects that helped me go from 0-1 as a programmer and i know with AI and "vibe coding" and MCP's i dont have to do all these but i just love this craft too much ig. Consider this repo as my study journal/guide.



### PHASE 1: Learn by being in the trenches(coding in c for a month)
- Finish k&r book and do all the exercises
-  Implement basic data structures in C (linked lists, stacks, queues)
#### Practical Projects to build:
- Build a blog app in pure c
- Build a memory allocator (malloc implementation)
- Build your own shell: https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/
- Text editor implementation: https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/


### PHASE 2: Operating Systems & Computer Architecture
Study: 
- "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces"
    - Take detailed notes on process mgmt, virtual memory, file systems
- Read "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective"
- "Programming from the Ground Up"

Practical Projects
-  Write a bootloader
- Implement a hobby OS kernel with basic functionality
    - Resource: OSDev Wiki
- Simple device drivers (keyboard, screen)
- Implement a basic file system

### PHASE 3: Kernel Development Basics
Theory & Study:
- Read "Linux Kernel Development" by Robert Love
- tudy "Linux Device Drivers" (LDD3)
- Join kernel newbies mailing list and follow discussions
- Study Linux kernel source (start with small subsystems)

#### Practical Projects
- Write a Hello World kernel module
- Implement a character device driver
- Build a virtual file system module
- Network driver or protocol implementation
- Contribute documentation fix to Linux kernel

### PHASE 4: Advanced Topics & Specialization
Choose a path:
 - Kernel Security
 - File Systems
 - Networking Stack
 - Virtualization/Containers

### Major Projects
- Get a patch accepted into Linux kernel
- Build a complete hobby OS with multiple features
- Implement a database engine from scratch
- Create specialized system tools


### Current Progress
- Doing k&r 

### Notes to Self
- Consistent daily practice is more important than marathon sessions
- Document all bugs and their solutions
- When stuck on something for >2 hours, take a break or ask for help
- Focus on understanding, not just making things work
- Review fundamentals regularly

### Graduation Tests
- Get a patch accepted into Linux kernel
- Build and document a complete OS kernel from scratch
- Interview confidently for kernel/systems positions
