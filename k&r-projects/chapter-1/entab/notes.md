Write a program that replaces strings of blanks by the minimum number of tabs and blanks to achieve the same spacing. Use the same tab stops as for detab. When either a tab or a single blank would suffice to reach a tab stop, which should be given prefrence

- strings of blanks -> spaces
- replace it with minumum number of tabs -> '\t'

take the input and replace any spaces with appropriate number of tabs

stupid explanation:
- if we have four spaces replace it with 2 tabs 
- if we have 5 spaces -> 2 tabs + 1 space
