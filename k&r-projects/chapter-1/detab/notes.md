Q.Write a program detab that replaces tabs in an input with proper number of blanks to space to the next tab stop. Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every n columns. Should n be a variable or a symolic parameter.

symbloic parameter -> #define MAX 1;

explanation:
-> create a simple program called detab which takes in an input and if it sees a tab in the input it replaces it with adequate amount of space to replace tab hence it should look the same.

If  Hello   World 
we'll do 4 spaces to replace the tab
