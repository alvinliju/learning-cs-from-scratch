- A `#define` line defines a symbolic name or symbolic constant to be a particular string of characters.
- The name has the same form as a variable name: a sequence of letters and digits that begins with a letter. The replacement text can be any sequence of characters; it is not limited to numbers.
`#define LOWER 0 /* lower limit of table */`

* `getchar` and `putchar` are the simplest way to input and output a character in c.

- long integers are at least 32 bits
- A character written between single quotes represents an integer value equal to the numerical
value of the character in the machine's character set.

## Variables
- variables are created to store stuffs.
- variables have a context.
- context is nothing but where the variable is created.
- it can be created inside a function and the varible is only created when we call the function and when the function does its job the varibale gets deleted..

what will we do if we need persistance?
- we'll just initlize the varible outside the function.
