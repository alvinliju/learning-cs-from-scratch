how to build a keyboard from scratch..

question i have:
1.how does a keyboard work?
2.how will the computer know which key we are currently.
3.how does the whole bluetooth keyboard shi works?

- keybaord has a lot of switches
- switches works by closing circuits
- we use diodes for one way electricity flow(to detect multiple key presses)
- we use a micro controller to map the whole keyboard and scan for any input(atmega32u4)
- we flash a custom firnware with aurdino ide

and thats how to make a custom keyboard for yourself
